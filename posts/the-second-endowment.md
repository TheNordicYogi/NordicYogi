## Introduction

Long has the elusive and mysterious "Second Endowment" been talked about among Latter-Day Saints. Many do not know that it exists. Those who do, do not know what it is - or what takes place.

There is very little to be said, since the nature of the ceremony is secretive. Here I will bring to light a first hand account; paired with the doctrines of Christianity, as well as the Mormon Church. I hope to bring further understanding into this practice and it’s significance.

### Giovanni Stefano Danedi - Jesus Washing the Feet of the Apostles

It is important beforehand to have context. I will start by touching on the First and Second Comforter, and their relationship to the Second Endowment.

## First Comforter

The first ordinance in Mormonism is the receiving of the Holy Ghost through baptism. During the baptism, the Missionary doing the baptizing says: [[1]](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings/baptism-and-confirmation?lang=eng)

> _“Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost"_

### Baptismal Font - Phoenix Arizona Temple

After the candidate has been baptized, the baptism must be confirmed. The confirmation is a blessing performed by the “Authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood”, it CONFIRMS them a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and bestows the gift of the Holy Ghost by saying:

> _“Receive the Holy Ghost"_

Or in traditional fundamentalism

> _“Receive ye the gift of the Holy Ghost"_

This ordinance gives one **_cause_** to receive a comforter of the Holy Ghost. This is the same comforter spoken of by Jesus Christ in the gospel of John.[[2]](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14?lang=eng)

> _““And I will pray the father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you forever”_
>
> _“But the comforter, **WHICH IS THE HOLY GHOST**, whom the father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you”_

![The Holy Spirit Giaquinto, Corrado](/images/second-endowment-assets/holy-ghost-depiction.jpg)

### Giaquinto, Corrado - The Holy Spirit

It must be emphasized, that at the time of confirmation, NOBODY receives a comforter of the Holy Ghost. There may be few, but it would be highly uncommon. The key point here is cause. One would now have access to the mind and will of God! Access to be "taught all things". Whether or not one uses that cause to receive a comforter is another story.

In Mormonism, we know that Faith comes before action.[[3]](https://lecturesonfaith.com/1/)

> _"From this we learn, that faith is the assurance which men have of the existence of things which they have not seen; and the principle of action in all intelligent beings"_

And that Belief comes before knowledge.[[4]](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/11?lang=eng)

> _"Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?"_

Receiving the Holy Ghost will often come before the comforter, or witness, of it. Although people who have never been baptized have received a witness , it does not always mean they have received a comforter that the Holy Ghost IS the pure intelligence of God.

That is what the Comforter is! A knowledge, not a belief, that the Holy Ghost is the Pure Intelligence of God. Joseph Smith said regarding this: [[5]](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-3-chapter-25)

> _"There are two Comforters spoken of. One is the Holy Ghost, the same as given on the day of Pentecost, and that all Saints receive after faith, repentance, and baptism. This first Comforter or Holy Ghost has no other effect than pure intelligence. It is more powerful in expanding the mind, enlightening the understanding, and storing the intellect with present knowledge, of a man who is of the literal seed of Abraham, than one that is a Gentile, though it may not have half as much visible effect upon the body; for as the Holy Ghost falls upon one of the literal seed of Abraham, it is calm and serene; and his whole soul and body are only exercised by the pure spirit of intelligence;"_

![Joseph Smith preaching, Sam Lawlor](/images/second-endowment-assets/js-preaching.jpg)

### Joseph Preaching - By Sam Lawlor

In recap, receiving the Holy Ghost isn’t the same as the First Comforter. The First Comforter isn't the same as receiving the Holy Ghost. It’s confusing, I know. One leads to the other. The First Comforter comes to one who has faithfully sought after the Holy Ghost and it's companionship. The ordinance of Baptism and Confirmation set one apart, to go forward and pursure truth and light, that they may receive a Comforter.

## Second Comforter

Well, here is where it gets tricky.

The First Endowment has nothing to do with the First Comforter. **_But the Second Endowment directly correlates to the Second Comforter_**. The Second Endowment is to the Second Comforter, as Baptism is to the first. Baptism gives cause to receive the First Comforter. Similarly, the Second Endowment gives you cause to see Jesus Christ in the flesh, to receive a comforter of him - **FROM** him. As Jesus says:[[6]](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng)

> _"This Comforter is the promise which I give unto you of eternal life, even the glory of the celestial kingdom;"_

![Joseph Smith receives vision of the Celestial Kingdom](/images/second-endowment-assets/js-celestial-kingdom.jpg)

### Joseph Smith receives vision of the Celestial Kingdom

Cause to receive the Second Comforter is given to one in the Second Endowment, similar to the First Comforter given to one in the Baptismal confirmation.

Most Mormons are taught that the Second Endowment is Jesus Christ making himself manifest. I will show you why they are wrong, and how they've confused it with the Second Comforter. It makes far more sense, with all context and scripture, that it only gives one **cause** to see Christ. It would also be far more consistent with other similar ordinances. So lets dive in. Jesus said:[[6]](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng)

> _"Wherefore, I now send upon you another Comforter, even upon you my friends, that it may abide in your hearts, even the Holy Spirit of promise; which other Comforter is the same that I promised unto my disciples, as is recorded in the testimony of John. This Comforter is the promise which I give unto you of eternal life, even the glory of the celestial kingdom"_

So here we have established from Jesus Christ that the Second Comforter is the Holy Spirit of Promise. What is that promise?

> _"..the promise which I (Jesus) give unto you of eternal life, even the glory of the celestial kingdom "_

![The Triumphs of Fame, Time and Eternity - Francesco Pesellino 1450](/images/second-endowment-assets/eternity.jpg)

### The Triumphs of Fame, Time and Eternity - Francesco Pesellino 1450

And what did Jesus promise to his disciples “As is recorded in the Testimony of John”?[[2]](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14?lang=eng)

> _"I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you."_

Jesus Christ himself is the fulfillment of the Holy Spirit of Promise. Here is what Joseph Smith had to say:[[7]](https://scriptures.byu.edu/tpjs/STPJS.pdf)

> _"Now what is this other Comforter? It is no more nor less than the Lord Jesus Christ Himself; and this is the sum and substance of the whole matter; that when any man obtains this last Comforter, he will have the personage of Jesus Christ to attend him, or appear unto him from time to time, and even He will manifest the Father unto him, and they will take up their abode with him, and the visions of the heavens will be opened unto him, and the Lord will teach him face to face, and he may have a perfect knowledge of the mysteries of the Kingdom of God; and this is the state and place the ancient Saints arrived at when they had such glorious visions—Isaiah, Ezekiel, John upon the Isle of Patmos, St. Paul in the three heavens, and all the Saints who held communion with the general assembly and Church of the Firstborn."_

So, we do have ourselves a bit of a contradiction.

Joseph Smith says that:

> _"It is no more nor less than the Lord Jesus Christ Himself"_

Jesus said:

> _"I will come to you"_

However, Jesus also said

> _"I now send upon you another Comforter, even upon you my friends, that it may abide in your hearts, even the Holy Spirit of promise"_

Which is it? The Holy Spirit of Promise, or Jesus Christ himself?

Now you may begin to understand why I put so much emphasis on the First Comforter. One receives the Holy Ghost at the confirmation of ones Baptism. They are obtaining cause to move forward and receive a COMFORTER from the Holy Ghost. Almost identically in the Second Endowment, hands are laid upon ones head and they are GIVEN the Holy Spirit of Promise. This is the promise of eternal life, even the glory of the celestial kingdom. The comforter, of that promise, is Jesus Christ in the flesh!

### Artistic rendition of Jesus - from an impression on the Shroud of Turin

As repetitious as it may sound, it's important to understand. Mormonism can be confusing. More clarity will come as we dissect the Second Endowment.

## The Second Endowment

In the Gospel of John [[8]](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/13?lang=eng), Jesus was performing an ordinance upon his disciples. Which gives a small hint to the Second Endowment Ceremony, as well as why it’s synonymously referred to as the Second Anointing. The First Anointing being in the First Endowment. Here's what it said:

> _"After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me."_

Read that again.

> _"If I wash thee not, though has not part with me"_

Jesus said, in arguably the most quoted scripture in Mormonism, to Joseph Smith: [[9]](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng)

> _"All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations, or expectations, that are not made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed, both as well for time and for all eternity, and that too most holy, by revelation and commandment through the medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this power , are of no efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made unto this end have an end when men are dead."_

From this we can take away that ones Marriage, Baptism, Covenant Children, First Endowment and lifes work are of "no efficacy" and will "have an end when men are dead" if they do not receive this Promise. Further emphasizing what Jesus meant when he told Peter “if I wash thee not, though hast no part with me”

### Rafaello Sanzio of Urbino: The Resurrection

It is often thought in Mormonism, especially in Mormon fundamentalism, that the Holy Spirit of Promise is implied in the First Endowment ceremony. But the First Endowment ceremony is still PREDICATED on ones faithfulness, while the Second Endowment isn’t. So it cannot be implied. The Second Endowment explicitly seals one up to eternal life with the Holy Spirit of Promise.

In "Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith", Joseph Smith teaches: [[7]](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng)

> _"Peter exhorts us to make our calling and election sure. This is the sealing power spoken of by Paul in other places. [[10]](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng)"_
>
> _"In whom ye also trusted, that after ye heard the word of truth, the Gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of His glory, that we may be sealed up unto the day of redemption."_

That is the meaning of having your "Calling and Election made sure". To be sealed up "unto the day of redemption".

### The Dream of Solomon - Luca Giordano

## The Ordinance

Now that I have over explained lets talk about a first hand account of a man who’s had the Second Endowment performed on him by M. Russell Ballard, an Apostle of the Mormon Church, at the appointment of Gordon B Hinckley. [[11]](https://www.exmormon.org/mormon/mormon508.htm)

> _"In April 2002 Elder Harold G. Hillam of the First Quorum of Seventy, as President of the Europe West Area, called me into his office. He said he was extending to me and my wife (she was not present), on behalf of President Hinckley, an invitation to receive a 'special blessing' in the Preston England Temple. He asked whether I had heard of the 'second endowment' to which I replied no. I later told him that I had heard of it, but was so stunned by his invitation my mind went blank regarding the matter."_

In passing, notice that it was on behalf of President Hinckley. This is consistent with:

> _"of him who is anointed" [[9]](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng)"_

Moving on...

> _"He told me very few people receive this blessing and it must be kept secret. He said if the general membership knew about it there would be problems. More would want to receive the ordinance than the apostles have time to accommodate and members would wonder why 'so and so' had received it but they had not. I must not even tell my children. He said I should just tell them that their mother and I were going away for the day or weekend. He recommended I read all that Elder Bruce R. McConkie had written on the subject of 'making your calling and election sure'."_
>
> _"I read all that Elder McConkie had written on the subject and looked forward to the day with excitement. Elder McConkie wrote that , during the first endowment you are given certain blessings to become a king and a priest (queen and priestess) to the most high God, and these blessings are conditional on you remaining worthy of them. With the second endowment, the conditions are removed as you have already proven your faithfulness and entitlement to the blessings. Therefore, you are sealed up to the highest degree of the celestial kingdom unconditionally. Any sins committed afterward may render you liable to the 'buffetings in the flesh' but they will not prevent you from attaining your exaltation. The only sin that is unpardonable is denying the Holy Ghost (or in some passages the shedding of innocent blood). "_
>
> _"Upon entering the temple we changed into our temple robes...Elder Ballard explained what would be happening. We were to have our feet washed and be anointed by him. He was acting under the direction of the Prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley. We would then be allocated a sealing room for each couple to be alone and perform the second part of the ordinance. We would then all meet again with Elder Ballard in the celestial room."_

Just the same way that Jesus washed and anointed his disciples..

> _"I. THE ORDINANCE OF THE WASHING OF THE FEET I was beckoned to sit on a particular chair. Elder Ballard knelt and washed my feet, then dried them. This ordinance cleansed me from the blood and sins of this generation."_
>
> _"II. THE ORDINANCE OF SECOND ANOINTINGS -- Part One Anointed & Ordained a King/Priest, Queen/Priestess"_
>
> _"I was anointed with oil, on the top of my head, and then hands were laid upon my head, and I was ordained a king and a priest unto the Most High God, to rule and reign in the House of Israel forever. My head, brow, eyes, ears nose, lips etc. were anointed with oil and specific blessings were given related to knowing, understanding and speaking the truth. This ordinance gave me the ***fullness of the priesthood*** and a blessing was given which included the following:"_
>
> _"Sealing power to bind & loose, curse & bless."_
>
> _Blessings of Abraham, Isaac & Jacob._
>
> _***The Holy Spirit of Promise bestowed.***_
>
> _Blessed to live as long as life is desirable._
>
> _Blessed to attain unto the Godhood._
>
> _Power to be a member of a Godhead bestowed._
>
> _Sealed up to eternal life_
>
> _Power to have the heavens opened."_

And there you have it. One will receive the Holy Spirit of Promise, as well as the "power to have the heavens opened". This further proves that the Holy Spirit of Promise is preparatory to opening the heavens, and receiving a witness of Jesus Christ

> _"We were charged not to reveal to other individuals that we had received this ordinance. My wife was also anointed and ordained a queen and priestess."_
>
> _"***THE ORDINANCE OF SECOND ANOINTINGS*** -- Part Two 'The Washing of The Feet', Wife to Husband"_
>
> _"The second part of the second anointing was explained to us. We (my wife and I) were to go to another sealing room where we would be alone as a couple. There would be a bowl of water and a towel. My wife was to wash my feet (as Mary did to Jesus) and dry them. She would then place her hands upon my head and pronounce a blessing upon me as the spirit dictated. This was a very moving and personal experience for us as a couple and we both ended in tears of great joy. Following this we met in the celestial room with Elder Ballard and the others. Elder Ballard summarized what had happened and asked if there were any questions as they could only be answered at this time, in this place as we were charged to tell nobody that we had received this ordinance."_

## Conclusion

So who cares?

In Mormonism, members lay claim to the fact that Christians have lost the priesthood, and certainly access to the Second Endowment. Just about the only ordinance in Christianity is baptism, and every denomination has their opinions on how it should be performed.

Mormonism and it's endowments play on the subtle implications and ordinances throughout the New and Old Testament. Joseph Smith was very keen and well read. Although most of his knowledge came from Masonry, his knowledge of the scripture and it's endowments hold up to this day.
Certainly Smiths ability continues to set Mormonism apart.

To further demonstrate the beautiful ability that Smith had, not only with knowledge of the scripture, but in penning them, I will end this Blog with section 76 [[12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng) of the Doctrine and Covenants. It is the description of one who has received this ordinance, and been given the Promise of eternal life. This was a vision Joseph Smith received of God's glory.
