## How I changed my Morning Routine

I am always skeptical when anyone wants to sell me anything, but as all good things come, I found it when I wasn't looking.

My friend wouldn't stop raving about **Early Bird** and it's incredible benefits. Feeling restless, consantly crashing from 3 cups of coffee per day, and the copious amounts of dairy that came long with it, I was desparate to try something different.

And boy, am I glad that I did. **Early Bird** has changed my life by changing my morning. I start every morning by drinking 12 ounces of **Early Bird** within 60 seconds of waking up. My far-more-skeptical wife is also sold! Since I started using **Early Bird** I haven't slept-in once, I don't crash at 2:00 PM, and I am far more productive. I look forward to my mornings!

THANK YOU, **EARLY BIRD**

## So what is Early Bird?

**Early Bird** is a "morning cocktail" designed to help you develop the habit of waking up early. With just a coffee-cup equivalent of caffeine, and an impressive lineup of micronutrients, it does just that.

The beauty of **Early Bird** is in it's simplicity. The creators discovered that most people were so tired when they woke up because they were **_dehydrated_**.
So they created a morning cocktail packed full of **vitamins**, **nootropics**, **electrolytes** and **micro-nutrients** to jumpstart your morning!

The best part?

**0 Sugar**

**0 Carbohydrates**

**0 Calories**

**No Artificial Coloring**

It's really that easy. The routine follows the basic philosophy of Habit building as laid out in _The Power of Habit_. There is a **Que**, **Routine** and **Reward**.

Simply decide what time you want to wake up, make sure you have your shaker bottle ready, and go to sleep knowing that tomorrow will be productive!
